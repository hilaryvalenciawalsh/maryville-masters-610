# A common punishment for school children is to write out
# a sentence multiple times.  Write a Python stand-alone program
# that will write the following sentence one hundred times:
# "I will never spam my friends again."

# for loop, looping 100 times
for i in range(100):
    print("I will never spam my friends again")
